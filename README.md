The following is a Gentoo layman addition to the portage for those interested in Bitcoin and digital distribution of data.

All software within this portage are sources from multiple projects that can sourced directly and might have different licences.

A summary of a licenses that I am aware of will be update to the License folder and when required referenced.

Please reach out, if any mistakes, the aim is to allow others the correct level access to the sources so they can use the technology.
