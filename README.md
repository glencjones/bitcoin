The following is a Gentoo layman addition to the portage for those interested in Bitcoin and digital distribution of data.

All software within this portage are sourced from multiple projects that can be obtained directly.  Note each downloaded build might 
have a different licence.  So please pay attention to additional restrictions outside of the Gentoo ebuild packaging.

A copy of any licenses that I am aware of will be be placed in the License folder and when required referenced.

Please reach out, if any mistakes, the aim is to allow others the correct level access to the sources so they can use the technology.
